# üßº Layoff Data Cleaning for EDA (SQL Project)

---

## üìå Overview

This project focuses on cleaning a messy global layoff dataset from Kaggle to prepare it for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The goal was to fix duplicates, standardize data formats, handle missing values, and tidy up the structure ‚Äî so the data is ready for real analysis.

## üìÅ About This Project

This cleaning project is part of the **Alex The Analyst Bootcamp**, where I practiced using **SQL to clean real-world datasets**.

It helped me sharpen my hands-on skills with data preparation and gave me confidence working with messy, unstructured data.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

- **Source:** [Layoffs 2022 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)
- **Type:** Global layoffs, 2020‚Äì2022
- **Includes:** Company name, location, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, funding raised, stage, and date

## üîß What I Did

- ‚úÖ Created a **safe staging table** to protect the original dataset
- ‚úÖ **Removed duplicates** using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs
- ‚úÖ **Standardized text fields** (company, industry, location)
- ‚úÖ **Converted date column** from text to SQL `DATE` format
- ‚úÖ **Handled missing values** by converting blanks to `NULL` and filling missing values using self joins
- ‚úÖ **Dropped unreliable rows/columns** to clean the dataset thoroughly
